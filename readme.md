Welcome to **CodeLab**, a repository where I practice various techniques and programming concepts. This project is a hands-on learning space for experimenting with algorithms, design patterns, scripting, and more.

## About

This repository includes:

- **Algorithms**: Various algorithms implemented for practice and optimization.
- **Data Structures**: Different data structures with custom implementations.
- **Automation**: Scripts for web scraping, task automation, and API interactions.
- **Design Patterns**: Exploring different software design patterns in real-world applications.
- **Multithreading/Concurrency**: Practice with Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor` and concurrent programming.
- **Web Development**: Simple web apps and API projects for learning front-end and back-end technologies.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore and experiment with the code. Each folder contains a set of exercises, implementations, and experiments in various programming languages and frameworks.
